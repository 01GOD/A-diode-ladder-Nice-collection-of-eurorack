### Inputs
CLOCK input with 1 clock-pulse per step the advance is made on the low-to-high transition of the signal.
RESET input which resets the current pattern to step 1 at the low-to-high transition.

### Outputs
GATE output that is held high during the high period of the CLOCK input signal.
1V/OCT output with note pitch voltage (0.833-2.833V)
VCF CV output with programmable voltage 0-5V
ACCENT output programmable On/Off

### Steps and Patterns
A total of 10 patterns with pattern length 3-16 steps where each step have the following programmable functions:
 - Note pitch (or rest)
 - Tie note to next step
 - Slide to next step
 - VCF CV voltage

### User Interface
Consists of the 0.96" OLED, two pushbuttons and a rotary encoder with a pushbutton switch.

EDIT button accesses menus for editing pattern steps.

MENU button accesses the following functions:
