This Utility Mixer is a "Swiss Army-knife" for mixing modulation sources together and adding an offset voltage, but it can ofcourse be used as an 
audio-mixer for mixing together oscillators, noise and other sources. The mixer is DC-coupled.

### Inputs
There are 4 attenuverter inputs with a gain of +/- 1.0. IN1, IN2 and IN3 is connected to GND and IN4 is connected to the voltage reference 
if nothing is connected to the input jack.

### Outputs
Two outputs

### Level indicator
The output level is shown on a LED indicator.
Levels below 1 dB are shown with a Green light, between 1 and 4 dB is shown with Amber and more than 4 dB is Red.

### Voltage reference
