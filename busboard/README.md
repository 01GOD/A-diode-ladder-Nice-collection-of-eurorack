# busboard
![busboard image](BUSBOARD.jpg)

A small busboard with room for 10 pcs 16-pin boxed headers and provisions for a +5VDC linear regulator. 
The board has both input and output connectors for the power-rails so two boards can be daisy-chained.

An STL-file mounting plate that fits the board can be downloaded from Thingiverse:
